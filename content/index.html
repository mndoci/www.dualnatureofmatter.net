<p><em>The Dual Nature of Matter</em> is a musical project from Deepak Singh, usually exploring various abstract sonic landscapes</p>

<p>You can find all my music on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/dnm">Soundcloud</a>.

<p>All music is recorded in a <a href="https://github.com/mndoci/mndoci.github.com/wiki/home-recording-setup">small home studio</a> that has evolved over the years from an almost exclusively software-based setup (with hardware controllers) to a mixed hardware/software setup.</p>
